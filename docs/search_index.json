Case study guides can be used 1) in the classroom (either onsite or online) by engaging students to actively participate in a hands-on problem-solving experience, and 2) outside of the classroom by providing an archive of stand-alone examples of best practices. To help guide educators on how to most effectively use the Open Case Studies (either in or outside of the classroom), this guide documents examples of how to use the case studies, various entry points to using the case studies (including an R package to enable modular use of the case studies), how to modify and adapt components of the case studies for the classroom, and how to contribute new case studies.

The intention of this guide is to provide instructors more information about how to make the most of our case studies. 1.2 Target Audience This guide is intended for educators who are interested in using the Open Case Studies for instruction. Elements of the Case studies can be helpful for instructors who teach: High school students Undergraduate students Graduate students Elements of the case studies can assist with teaching courses about the following topics: Data science Statistics Public health Programming Technical writing … and more 1.3 Curriculum This guide documents: The open case studies philosphy The general structure of case studies Various entry points to using the case studies (including an R package to enable modular use of the case studies) Examples of how to use the case studies How to modify and adapt components of the case studies for the classroom How to contribute new case studies. 1.4 Open Case Studies Philosophy 1.5 Open Case Studies Anatomy Case studies are designed to be self-contained examples of complete data analyses. They start with a subject area of interest and a problem definition. Each case study is composed of three main stages. - Stage 1: Getting Started In the first stage, students learn about the subject area they will be investigating in their data analysis. This can include historical perspectives, previous literature, and current overarching questions in the field. Ideally, this will provide motivation as to why the data analysis they will be performing is interesting and useful. Students will then further refine questions of interest and define a specific question to be investigated by the data at hand. This question will define the statistical and data science learning objectives for the case study. Finally, students will explore the limitations of their investigation and discuss why their data analysis may or may not be able to fully answer the main question of interest. - Case study context - Study motivation - Main question - Learning objectives - Study limitations Stage 2: Analyzing the Data This stage includes the bulk of the data analysis. It begins with a detailed description of the data used in the case study, how it was generated, and where is was obtained. This sets the stage for a walk-through of the data import procedure and exploration of the available data. From there, the specific subsets of the data relevant to answering the main question of interest can be identified and the data can be cleaned and wrangled to give the data in the required format. The cleaned data can then be visualized and analyzed to answer the study question. Data description Import and exploration Wrangling Visualization Analysis Stage 3: Wrapping-Up In the final stage of the case study, students synthesize conclusions to the main study question based on the results of their data analysis. They summarize the data exploration and analysis steps they took and discuss potential next steps they could take based on their results. Finally, additional analyses are suggested as homework and additional information relevant to the case study is provided.

The website also includes a link to a user experience survey (takes up to 10 minutes to complete), which helps us learn more about how to improve the data science education experience. Part of this includes getting a better understanding of who is using our case studies and how so that we can better design our case studies. We would greatly appreciate you filling it out if you have the time! Finally, the website includes the OCS case study search tool to aid instructors in finding appropriate case studies for their learning objectives. The search tool is described in more detail below. 2.3 OCS Case Study Search Tool The OCS case study search tool is designed to aid instructors in identifying appropriate case studies for their learning objectives. The tool consists of a table with searchable columns, where each row is an individual case study. The main two columns likely to be helpful in identifying appropriate case studies are the “Packages” and “Objectives” columns. The “Packages” column details all the R packages used in the case study, and can help identify if a case study teaches a specific data import, wrangling, analysis, or visualization skill. The “Objectives” column details the learning objectives of each case study (e.g. importing data from PDF files, reshaping data, specific statistical analysis, etc.). The table also includes links to both the static and interactive versions oof the case studies and their GitHub repositories. (Include example of one case study row) 2.4 GitHub Organization The GitHub repository contains all the materials needed for the case study. This includes the case study text to be distributed to students, the data used in the case study (discussed below), additional documents and references, and brief guidelines on case study use. Data included in the GitHub repository is available in multiple formats to facilitate modularization of the case studies as described below. To use the case study data, you can download the GitHub repository directly or use the OCSdata R package described below. (Add figure 2.4 outlining repo structure) 2.5 OCSdata To simplify the process of accessing the data required for each case study, we have created the OCSdata R package. Briefly, the OCSdata package creates a new folder called “OCSdata” where it downlaods the data needed for a specific case study. Users can download the data in its original raw format or in various processed formats that correspond to different stages of data wrangling and cleaning. This allows users to perform the data exploration and wrangling or the data visualization and analyis sections of the case study without having to process the data from the raw files. For some of the case studies, the OCSdata package also downloads extra source data that is not used in the case study. (Add table 2.1 summarizing data formats available for download via OCSdata) 2.5.1 Getting Started with OCSdata The OCSdata package is available on the package repository CRAN and can be installed in R as follows: [R version equirement?] install.packages(&quot;OCSdata&quot;) #only run once to install package library(OCSdata) #run every new R session to load package 2.5.2 Downloading raw data The raw_data function will download the raw data files that can be imported into R. The first argument is the name of the case study. A list of case study names can be found in the package documentation online or by typing ?raw_data in R. The outpath argument is a string specifying the folder where the data should be downloaded. To download the data to a folder named “OCS_data” in the current working directory, you can supply getwd() to the output argument. If nothing is provided for the argument, you will be prompted to enter 1, 2, or 3 to download the data into the current director, to specify the download path, or to cancel, respectively. In the following example, we download the raw data for the “Opioids in the United States” case study to the current directory. raw_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.3 Downloading data in other formats The OCSdata package can be used to download the data in various processed formats that may be helpful in skipping certain case study sections and focusing on data wrangling and/or analysis and visualization. All of the functions take the same arguments described above. 2.5.3.1 Simpler import The simpler_import_data function will download raw data files that have been converted to file formats that are easier to import into R, typically .csv. Some case studies offer this option when the original raw files require a more complicated import step. simpler_import_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.3.2 Importing data as R objects The imported_data function will download raw data files in .rda format. This means the data have already been imported into R objects. This can be used to skip the data import section and start directly with data wrangling. The R objects files can be imported into R by either double clicking on the files in Rstudio or using the load() function as follows. imported_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) #download data in .rda format file_path = &quot;~/OCS_data/data/imported/land_area.rda&quot; #specify download directory load(file_path) #load R objects 2.5.3.3 Importing wrangled data The following functions will download the data files that have already been wrangled and are ready to be analyzed. These come in both .csv and .rda formats. Download as csv files: wrangled_csv(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) Downloading as R objects: wrangled_rda(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.4 Downloading extra data Some case studies have extra data are not used in the case study but can be used to explore the case study subject from different perspectives. These data but can This data can be downloaded using the extra_data function. extra_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.5 Downloading all case study data The zip_ocs function will download the all of the repository files in a .zip folder and unzip them into a specified directory. This includes the case study data in all the formats detailed above (raw, simpler_import, imported, wrangled, and extra). It also includes the case study .Rmd file, which can be modified by instructors as needed. zip_ocs(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.6 Forking the case study repository ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] bookdown_0.24 crayon_1.3.4 digest_0.6.25 R6_2.4.1 ## [5] lifecycle_1.0.0 magrittr_1.5 evaluate_0.14 pillar_1.4.6 ## [9] leanbuild_0.1.2 rlang_0.4.10 stringi_1.5.3 fs_1.5.0 ## [13] jquerylib_0.1.1 ellipsis_0.3.1 vctrs_0.3.4 rmarkdown_2.10 ## [17] tools_4.0.2 stringr_1.4.0 readr_1.4.0 hms_0.5.3 ## [21] xfun_0.26 yaml_2.2.1 compiler_4.0.2 pkgconfig_2.0.3 ## [25] htmltools_0.5.0 knitr_1.33 tibble_3.0.3 "],["use-of-open-case-studies.html", "Chapter 3 Use of open case studies 3.1 Learning Objectives 3.2 Libraries", " Chapter 3 Use of open case studies 3.1 Learning Objectives *Every chapter also needs Learning objectives that will look like this: This chapter will cover: 3.2 Libraries For this chapter, we’ll need the following packages attached: *Remember to add any additional packages you need to your course’s own docker image. library(magrittr) "],["topic-of-section.html", "Chapter 4 Topic of Section 4.1 Subtopic 4.2 Print out session info", " Chapter 4 Topic of Section You can write all your text in sections like this! 4.1 Subtopic Here’s a subheading and some text in this subsection! 4.1.1 Code examples You can demonstrate code like this: output_dir &lt;- file.path(&quot;resources&quot;, &quot;code_output&quot;) if (!dir.exists(output_dir)) { dir.create(output_dir) } And make plots too: hist_plot &lt;- hist(iris$Sepal.Length) You can also save these plots to file: png(file.path(output_dir, &quot;test_plot.png&quot;)) hist_plot ## $breaks ## [1] 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 ## ## $counts ## [1] 5 27 27 30 31 18 6 6 ## ## $density ## [1] 0.06666667 0.36000000 0.36000000 0.40000000 0.41333333 0.24000000 0.08000000 ## [8] 0.08000000 ## ## $mids ## [1] 4.25 4.75 5.25 5.75 6.25 6.75 7.25 7.75 ## ## $xname ## [1] &quot;iris$Sepal.Length&quot; ## ## $equidist ## [1] TRUE ## ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;histogram&quot; dev.off() ## png ## 2 4.1.2 Image example How to include a Google slide.
