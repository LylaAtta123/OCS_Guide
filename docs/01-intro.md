# Introduction


## Motivation
The [Open Case Studies project](https://www.opencasestudies.org), developed at the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](https://jhudatascience.org/), is an education platform that provides self-contained, multimodal, peer-reviewed, and open-source guides for real-world examples for active experiences of complete data analyses. The intention of this guide is to provide instructors more information about how to make the most of our case studies.


## Target Audience  

This guide is intended for educators who are interested in using the Open Case Studies for instruction.

Elements of the Case studies can be helpful for instructors who teach:

- High school students
- Undergraduate students
- Graduate students

Elements of the case studies  can assist with teaching courses about the following topics:

- Data science
- Statistics
- Public health
- Programming
- Technical writing  

... and more

## Curriculum  

This guide documents:

- The open case studies philosophy 
- The general structure of case studies
- Various entry points to using the case studies (including an R package to enable modular use of the case studies)
- Examples of how to use the case studies
- How to modify and adapt components of the case studies for the classroom
- How to contribute new case studies.

## Open Case Studies Anatomy

Case studies are designed to be self-contained examples of complete data analyses. They start with a subject area of interest and a problem definition. 

Each case study is composed of three main stages. 
- Stage 1: Getting Started 
In the first stage, students learn about the subject area they will be investigating in their data analysis. This can include historical perspectives, previous literature, and current overarching questions in the field. Ideally, this will provide motivation as to why the data analysis they will be performing is interesting and useful. Students will then further refine questions of interest and define a specific question to be investigated by the data at hand. This question will define the statistical and data science learning objectives for the case study. Finally, students will explore the limitations of their investigation and discuss why their data analysis may or may not be able to fully answer the main question of interest. 
	- Case study context 
	- Study motivation
	- Main question 
	- Learning objectives 
	- Study limitations 

- Stage 2: Analyzing the Data
This stage includes the bulk of the data analysis. It begins with a detailed description of the data used in the case study, how it was generated, and where is was obtained. This sets the stage for a walk-through of the data import procedure and exploration of the available data. From there, the specific subsets of the data relevant to answering the main question of interest can be identified and the data can be cleaned and wrangled to give the data in the required format. The cleaned data can then be visualized and analyzed to answer the study question. 
	- Data description
	- Import and exploration 
	- Wrangling 
	- Visualization 
	- Analysis 

- Stage 3: Wrapping-Up 
In the final stage of the case study, students synthesize conclusions to the main study question based on the results of their data analysis. They summarize the data exploration and analysis steps they took and discuss potential next steps they could take based on their results. Finally, additional analyses are suggested as homework and additional information relevant to the case study is provided.

	- Case study summary
	- Next steps 
	- Homework 
	- Additional info
