# Use of open case studies

## Learning Objectives

This chapter will provide guidance on how to use Open Case Studies in classroom settings for beginner, intermediate, and advanced students. Example uses will be discussed as well as suggestions for crafting homework assignments based on the case studies. 

## Open Case Studies in the Classroom

The case studies are structured to support both partial and full use of a case study.  

### Teaching a Full Case Study

The case studies are written to provide a cohesive story that simulates data science in the real world. Reading through an entire case study is an excellent exercise for students to experience a standard data science workflow and learn the best practices of today from start to finish. The following list provides a few examples of how educators have used a full case study in the past: 

- Converted the case study into a slide deck (add link, source and example image of slide)
- Assigned students to read the case study and write a report as homework
- Suggested reading and supplemental material 
- more? 

### Teaching Part of a Case Study

Some educators may find that only certain sections of a case study are relevant to their course learning objectives. For these educators the case studies are structured to allow for modular use. The case study ![GitHub repositories](https://github.com/opencasestudies) provide the appropriate data files to be used at the start of each section. These data files can be downloaded directly from GitHub or with the ![OCSdata](https://github.com/opencasestudies/OCSdata) package (see chapter 2.5). The following table describes which data folder contains the corresponding data for each case study section. An example use for each data type is provided as well. 

| Data Folder | Case Study Section | Example Use |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| raw | Data Import | Assigning public health students to read through a case study starting from the beginning |
| imported | Data Exploration, Data Wrangling | Data science students practicing wrangling methods with in class exercises |
| wrangled | Data Visualization, Data Analysis | Statistics course practicing analysis methods with real data as a live lesson |
| simpler_import | Data Import | Introductory data science instructor wants students to practice data import without over-complication |
| extra | Not Used in Case Study | Public health course assigns homework to practice case study methods with similar but new data | 

## Academic Levels

The following table lists the lowest recommended academic level that would be appropriate for each case study.
