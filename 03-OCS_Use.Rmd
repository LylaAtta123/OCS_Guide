# Use of open case studies

## Learning Objectives

This chapter will provide guidance on how to use Open Case Studies in classroom settings for beginner, intermediate, and advanced students. Example uses will be discussed as well as suggestions for crafting homework assignments based on the case studies. 

### Experience Level Descriptions

| Experience Level | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Beginner         | Little to no previous experience with coding and/or statistical analysis. |
| Intermediate     | Familiar with at least one programming language and has experience working with data and statistics. |
| Advanced         | Fluent in at least one programming language and likely familiar with more. Has a depth of experience working with data science projects. |

Typically, most middle/high school and first year undergraduate students will fit in the beginner category. Upperclassmen undergraduates and some graduate students are often at the intermediate level. Most advanced level students will be at the graduate level. However, this is a generalization, and a student may be considered beginner, intermediate, or advanced at any academic level depending on their independent studies and experiences. 

## Open Case Studies in the Classroom

The case studies are structured to support both partial and full use of a case study.  

### Teaching a Full Case Study

The case studies are written to provide a cohesive story that simulates data science in the real world. Reading through an entire case study is an excellent exercise for students to experience a standard data science workflow and learn the best practices of today from start to finish. The following list provides a few examples of how educators have used a full case study in the past: 

- Converted the case study into a slide deck (add link, source and example image of slide)
- Assigned students to read the case study and write a report as homework
- Suggested reading and supplemental material 
- more? 

### Teaching Part of a Case Study

Some educators may find that only certain sections of a case study are relevant to their course learning objectives. For these educators the case studies are structured to allow for modular use. The case study ![GitHub repositories](https://github.com/opencasestudies) provide the appropriate data files to be used at the start of each section. These data files can be downloaded directly from GitHub or with the ![OCSdata](https://github.com/opencasestudies/OCSdata) package (see chapter 2.5). The following table describes which data folder contains the corresponding data for each case study section. An example use for each data type is provided as well. 

| Data Folder | Case Study Section | Example Use |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| raw | Data Import | Assigning public health students to read through a case study starting from the beginning |
| imported | Data Exploration, Data Wrangling | Data science students practicing wrangling methods with in class exercises |
| wrangled | Data Visualization, Data Analysis | Statistics course practicing analysis methods with real data as a live lesson |
| simpler_import | Data Import | Introductory data science instructor wants students to practice data import without over-complication |
| extra | Not Used in Case Study | Public health course assigns homework to practice case study methods with similar but new data | 

## Case Study Reccomendations

The following table lists a few example case studies that would be suitable for each experience level. 

| Experience Level | Case Studies |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Beginner         | ![Exploring CO2 emissions across time](https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/), ![Vaping Behaviors in American Youth](https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-vaping-case-study/) |
| Intermediate     | ![Mental Health of American Youth](https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-youth-mental-health/), ![Opioids in United States](https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban/) |
| Advanced         | ![Influence of Multicollinearity on Measured Impact of Right-to-Carry Gun Laws Part 1](https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-RTC-wrangling/), ![Influence of Multicollinearity on Measured Impact of Right-to-Carry Gun Laws Part 2](https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-RTC-analysis/) |
